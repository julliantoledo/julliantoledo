# Hi, I’m Jullian Toledo  
I’m an aspiring engineer, roboticist, and developer with a passion for building real-world AI systems that help people.

## What I’m Working On
I’m currently building a modular AI system focused on computer vision and analysis. Some of the key features I’m developing include:
- Facial recognition and demographic prediction (age, sex, ethnicity)
- Expression analysis 
- Micro-expression recognition
- Voice interaction 

Built using: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Detectron2, PyQt, Arduino, ESP32-CAM

## Tech I’m Working With
- AI / CV: PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Detectron2
- Robotics & Hardware: Arduino, ESP32, sensors, servos
- UI: PyQt5
- Tools: GitHub, VSCode, LM Studio, Linux/macOS

## My Goals
- Build AI-powered systems.
- Earn scholarships to support school and build more advanced projects
- Start my own robotics/AI company focused on real-world impact
